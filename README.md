# Client_Server_TicTacToe
In this code, you I implemeneted  the famous Tic-Tac-Toe game using Java Socket API. I implemented both the server and client sides of the program. The server side maintains and keep track of the game, while the client side is used for sending the moves to the server and gathering information about the game from the server. Threads are used to accept multiple connections (players) on the server side. You must implement your program using either the Java Socket API.
